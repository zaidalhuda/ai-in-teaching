```

**Data-Driven Instruction:**
```
"Based on the assessment results I uploaded, what are the top 3 misconceptions my students have about [concept], and what specific teaching strategies would address each one?"
```

### Configuration Prompt Template
```
You are a teaching assistant for [subject/grade level].
Context: [Brief description of your teaching context]
Default outputs: Clear headings, bullet points, tables when useful
Always provide: Sources for factual claims, limitations notes for complex topics
Never: Request or process personally identifiable information
Format preferences: [Specify your preferred output format]
Special considerations: [Any subject-specific needs]
```

## Module 3 - Essential Prompting Strategies

### The Prompting Framework

```
TASK: [What you want created - be specific]
CONTEXT: [Background information the AI needs]
AUDIENCE: [Who will use this - grade level, ability]
FORMAT: [How you want it structured]
CONSTRAINTS: [Limitations - time, word count, etc.]
EXAMPLES: [Show desired style if helpful]
```

### 12 Key Prompting Tips
1. **Start simple, then iterate** - Test small, add context only when needed
2. **Lead with clear action verbs** - write, classify, summarize, analyze
3. **Be specific about constraints** - word count, format, audience level
4. **Break complex tasks into steps** - Chain subtasks for better results
5. **Show don't tell** - Include 1-2 examples to anchor format
6. **Control output format** - Specify lists, headings, tables, JSON
7. **Use positive instructions** - Say what to do, not what to avoid
8. **Separate sections clearly** - Use ### to divide instruction/context/input
9. **Mind your prompt length** - Include only details that help the task
10. **Validate before finishing** - Ask AI to check requirements
11. **Reuse winning patterns** - Keep a library of effective prompts
12. **Avoid vague language** - Replace "good" with specific criteria

### Prompting Techniques

**Zero-Shot**: Give clear instruction without examples
```
"Create a 5-question quiz on photosynthesis for 8th grade students."
```

**Few-Shot**: Provide 1-3 examples to establish pattern
```
"Create discussion questions following this pattern:
Example: 'How does the author's use of imagery in paragraph 3 support the main theme?'
Now create 3 similar questions for chapters 4-6."
```

**Chain-of-Thought**: Ask for step-by-step reasoning
```
"Explain how to solve this math problem step by step, showing your reasoning at each stage."
```

- What assumptions are embedded?
- How does prompt phrasing change responses?
- What would different communities say about this?
```

**3. Fact-Checking Challenge**
```
Students verify AI-generated claims by:
- Cross-referencing with authoritative sources
- Identifying unsupported statements
- Finding contradictory evidence
- Rating confidence levels for each claim
```

**4. Prompt Engineering Lab**
```
Students iterate on prompts to achieve specific goals:

- Document what improvements work best
- Share successful patterns with class
```

### AI Literacy Prompt Templates

**Explain AI Limitations**
```
In student-friendly language, explain why AI sometimes:

```

---

## Module 7 - Ethical Considerations & Safety

### Privacy Protection Checklist
- ❌ Never input student names, grades, or personal information
- ✅ Use generic examples ("Student A scored 85%")
- ❌ Avoid uploading identifiable student work
- ✅ Create sample work for AI analysis instead
- ❌ Don't share class roster or family information
- ✅ Focus on educational content and general scenarios

### Bias Awareness Strategies

**Content Review Process**
1. Generate AI content
2. Check for missing perspectives
3. Verify factual accuracy
4. Test with diverse examples
5. Revise for inclusivity
6. Document limitations

**Student Bias Detection Training**
```
Teach students to ask:
- Who is represented in this response?
- Whose voices might be missing?
- What assumptions are being made?
- How might different groups respond?
- What questions should I ask next?
```

### Ethical Use Prompts

**Bias Check Template**
```
Review this AI-generated content for potential bias:
[Insert content]
Identify: Missing perspectives, unfair assumptions, stereotypes,
cultural limitations. Suggest 3 ways to make it more inclusive.
```

**Fact Verification Request**
```
Fact-check this information and identify any claims that need verification:
[Insert content]
Provide: Accuracy assessment, source recommendations, 
uncertainty flags for questionable claims.
