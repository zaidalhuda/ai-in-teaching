*Remember: AI is a powerful teaching tool, but human judgment, creativity, and relationship-building remain at the heart of great education. Use AI to enhance your teaching, not replace your professional expertise. In the Chinese educational context, AI should support both academic excellence in English and cultural identity development.*
