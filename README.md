## Module 7 - Teaching AI Literacy

### Essential AI Literacy Skills
- Understanding AI capabilities and limitations
- Recognizing bias in AI outputs
- Fact-checking AI-generated information
- Writing effective prompts
- Evaluating AI responses critically
- Understanding cultural and regional biases in different AI systems
- Recognizing the difference between real-time and static AI knowledge

### Basic Activities

**AI vs. Human Comparison**
Students research the same topic using AI and traditional sources, then compare results for accuracy, depth, and perspective.

**Bias Detection Exercise**
Students analyze AI responses for missing viewpoints, stereotypes, or unfair assumptions, particularly focusing on cultural and regional biases.

**Fact-Checking Challenge**
Students verify AI claims using authoritative sources and rate their confidence in each piece of information.

**Cross-Cultural AI Analysis**
Students compare responses from different AI systems (Western vs. Chinese, static vs. real-time) on the same topic to understand cultural and temporal perspectives in English-language outputs.

**Real-Time vs. Static Knowledge**
Students compare responses from Grok (real-time) and other AIs (static knowledge) to understand the importance of currency in information.

### Teaching AI Literacy Prompts

**Explain AI Limitations**
```
In student-friendly language for [course level], explain why AI sometimes:
- Provides incorrect information
- Shows bias in responses
- Can't replace human judgment
- May reflect cultural biases from training data
- Has different access to current information
Include 2 relevant examples from both Western and Chinese contexts.
Use clear English appropriate for ESL learners.
```

**Generate Discussion Questions**
```
Create 5 age-appropriate questions about AI ethics for [course level]:
Focus on privacy, fairness, responsible use, cultural sensitivity, and information currency.
Build from basic understanding to deeper thinking.
Include perspectives from different cultural contexts and time periods.
Use accessible English for ESL students.
```

**Cultural Bias Exploration**
```
Design an activity where students explore how different AI systems respond to questions about:
- Cultural traditions
- Historical events
- Social norms
- Current events (comparing real-time vs. static responses)
Help students understand why responses might vary and develop critical thinking skills.
Conduct activity entirely in English with cultural context support.
```

**Information Currency Activity** (using Grok):
```
Create a lesson comparing real-time AI responses with static AI knowledge:
- Have students ask the same question to Grok and another AI
- Compare currency and accuracy of information
- Discuss when real-time information is crucial vs. when static knowledge is sufficient
- Teach students to recognize and evaluate information freshness
```

*Remember: AI is a powerful teaching tool, but human judgment, creativity, and relationship-building remain at the heart of great education. Use AI to enhance your teaching, not replace your professional expertise. In the Chinese educational context, AI should support both academic excellence in English and cultural identity development. Consider the balance between real-time information and established knowledge when integrating different AI tools.*
