# AI in Teaching

A practical, step-by-step guide to help teachers plan **responsible, effective AI use** in courses — from policy and prompting to lessons, assessment, accessibility, and risk.

---

## Quick Start (10 minutes)

1) **Pick one main assistant** you’ll use this term  
   Recommended: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai).  
   (Choose one to reduce cognitive load; you can compare later.)

2) **Publish a short Class AI Use Agreement** (see Template below)  
   State where AI is **allowed / limited / not allowed**, how to **acknowledge AI use**, and privacy basics.

3) **Plan one AI-supported lesson** (see Module 4 below)  
   Use AI for ideation, materials, and differentiation — then **verify** and **cite** sources.

## Module 1 — Responsible, Human-Centred AI Use

**Principles**
- Keep **human agency** central; prioritize learning, not automation for its own sake.
- Provide **opt-outs** and human alternatives when AI assists decisions.
- Be transparent about **what AI can/can’t do** and its limitations.

**Class AI Use Agreement (Syllabus snippet — copy/adapt)**
> **Purpose**: AI can support brainstorming, drafting, and practice. It does **not** replace critical thinking or original work.  
> **Where allowed**: [e.g., ideation, outline, practice quizzes]. **Where limited**: [e.g., editing only]. **Not allowed**: [e.g., take-home exam answers].  
> **Privacy**: Do **not** upload personal/student data or assessments with PII.  
> **Quality & Bias**: Verify facts, check sources, and reflect on bias.  
> **Credit**: When AI is used, include an “AI Assistance” note (see section below).  
> **Equity**: Alternative non-AI paths are available for all required tasks.  
> **Opt-out**: Students may choose human alternatives for AI-enabled features.

---

## Module 2 — Choose & Configure Your Main Assistant

Pick one: **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Gemini**, or **Perplexity**. Then **configure** it:
- Set audience and level (e.g., “first-year students”), expected output formats, and tone.
- Create a “profile prompt” that the assistant sees every time (your teaching context, constraints, and formatting needs).

For tool ideas beyond chat (lesson builders, quizzes, visuals), see the **Tools Directory** below; it includes Canva, Quizizz, MagicSchool, Eduaide, Curipod, NotebookLM, Brisk, and more.

## Module 3 — Prompting Patterns (Cheatsheet)

Use this **Prompt Skeleton** (fill in the brackets):
```
Role: You are a [subject] lecturer helping [level] students at Stirling College.
Task: [create X], aligned to [module outcomes].
Audience/Tone: [plain, accessible, bilingual if needed].
Constraints: [time limit, word count, sources to cite, region-specific examples].
Non-goals: [what to avoid/omit].
Quality checks: [fact-checking, bias check, add limitations note].
Output format: [markdown/slide outline/table].
```

**Reusable techniques**
- **Zero-shot** — clear instruction, no examples.  
- **Few-shot** — show 1–5 examples of the pattern.  
- **Meta-prompting** — give a schema/steps to follow.  
- **Self-consistency** — ask for multiple attempts, then choose the majority.  
- **Generate-knowledge → Answer** — list facts first, then answer.  
- **Chain-of-thought (teacher view)** — ask for steps + final answer.

---

## Module 4 — Lesson Planning with AI (Workflow)

**Outcome-first workflow (60 minutes)**
1) Paste module outcomes + week topic; ask for a **90-min active-learning lesson** with checks for understanding.  
2) Generate **materials**: slides outline, short reading, exit ticket.  
3) **Differentiate**: request basic/standard/challenge versions and multilingual glossary.  
4) **Verification pass**: require source links; then manually **spot-check**.

**Starter prompt**
```
Using the Prompt Skeleton, generate:
- A 90-min lesson on [topic], level [year/course], aligned to [outcomes].
- Two in-class activities and one short formative quiz (5 Qs + key).
- A differentiated reading (300 & 600 words).
- Add a bias-check and “limitations” note to the teacher version.
```

## Module 5 — Assessment, Integrity & the AI Assessment Scale

Use an **AI Assessment Scale** to clarify where/when AI fits in assessment (Levels 1–5 from “No AI” to “AI as co-pilot”). Include **controlled conditions** if declaring “No AI,” and provide **vignettes/examples** for each level.

**Why this matters**: As AI becomes common, transparent alignment to learning outcomes and validity is crucial (not just policing).

---

## Module 6 — Accessibility & Inclusive Design

- Use AI to **adapt** readings (simplify language, add examples, bilingual glossaries) and generate **multiple means of engagement**.  
- Follow **UDL (Universal Design for Learning)** and ensure equitable access when adopting tools.

---

## Module 7 — Data Privacy & Risk Awareness

- **Define AI & GenAI** clearly for staff and students (keep language plain).  
- Discuss **opportunities & risks** and stay current on privacy, data security, accessibility, and civil rights.  
- Watch for **PII leakage, opaque data collection, and deepfake risks** in AI-enhanced products.  
- Avoid uploading any **student-identifiable data**; keep custom assistants **private**.

---

## Module 8 — Build a Course-Specific Custom GPT (Optional)

- Upload only materials you **own** or can share (syllabus, rubrics, anonymized handouts).  
- Write instructions that reflect course standards, age level, and inquiry-based learning.  
- Keep it **private**; disclose if students will interact with it; provide **human alternatives** (opt-out).

---

## Policy Templates & Examples

### A) Syllabus AI Use Statement (copy/adapt)

- **Allowed**: brainstorming ideas, outlines, language refinement;  
- **Limited**: summarizing sources *with citations*;  
- **Not allowed**: generating final assignment text, take-home exam answers.  
- **Privacy**: do not upload personal data or identifiable student work.  
- **Acknowledgement**: include an “AI Assistance” note in submissions.  
- **Opt-out**: human alternatives available for any required AI feature.

### B) By-Assignment Examples

- **Reading response**: AI allowed to **outline** and **clarify**, student writes final text; attach outline + reflection.  
- **Lab report**: AI allowed to **format** and **grammar-check**; raw data analysis and discussion are student-authored.  
- **Oral viva**: AI may help generate **practice questions**; exam is in-person, AI-free (controlled).

### C) Classroom Practice Ideas
- Generate exercises, adapt texts to levels/ages, and pilot feedback reports; evaluate quality and limits; revert to **handwritten** or **in-class** when needed.  
- Use AI-generated texts as objects to **edit, verify sources, change register**, and **critique**.

## AI Tool Adoption Rubric

Score prospective tools (1–5) on:

1) **Accuracy & Learning Value** (aligns with outcomes; improves engagement/understanding)  
2) **Transparency** (explains limitations; shows sources when relevant)  
3) **Privacy & Data Minimization** (no PII required; clear data practices; retention controls)  
4) **Accessibility/UDL** (works with AT; multilingual support; low-bandwidth options)  
5) **Equity & Inclusion** (doesn’t disadvantage subgroups; supports diverse languages/cultures)  
6) **Opt-out Availability** (human alternative for any AI-enabled decision or feature)

---

## Custom GPT Instruction Template

Paste this into your assistant’s “system/instructions”:

```
You are a course assistant for [Course Name] at Stirling College (Chengdu University).
Goals: Support [level] students to meet [learning outcomes].
Do:
- Use plain language; scaffold explanations; offer structured outlines and examples.
- Ask one clarifying question only if essential to meet the request.
- Provide sources/links for factual claims; flag uncertainty and common misconceptions.
- Offer differentiated outputs (basic/standard/challenge) when preparing materials.
- Respect privacy: never request or process PII or student-identifiable work.
- Include a short “limitations & bias check” note for teacher-facing outputs.

Don’t:
- Produce final graded work or complete summative assessments.
- Fabricate citations or statistics; if unsure, say so and propose how to verify.
- Store or reuse any user content beyond the current session.

Formatting defaults:
- Use markdown with headings, bullet lists, and tables when helpful.
- End teacher materials with a quick verification checklist.

Ethics & Safety:
- Avoid harmful/biased content; offer inclusive, culturally aware examples.
- Provide human alternatives for any AI-enabled suggestion (opt-out).
```

## Acknowledging AI Assistance

Students (and staff) should credit AI support succinctly, e.g.:

> “**AI Assistance**: ChatGPT used for brainstorming structure and drafting a study plan. Sources were verified and all writing was reviewed and revised by the author.”

This encourages transparency without overstating reliance.
