- **Human-Centered**: AI assists learning but never replaces critical thinking
- **Transparent**: Always disclose AI use to students and colleagues
- **Equitable**: Provide non-AI alternatives for all activities
- **Ethical**: Respect privacy, avoid bias, and verify information
- **Educational**: Focus on learning enhancement, not task completion

### Sample Classroom AI Policy

> **AI Use Agreement for [Your Class]**
> 
> **Purpose**: AI supports brainstorming, feedback, and learning - not thinking replacement.
> 
> **✅ Allowed**: 
> - Brainstorming and idea generation
> - Grammar and clarity checking
> - Creating practice problems
> - Explaining difficult concepts
> - Generating discussion questions
> 
> **⚠️ Limited** (with acknowledgment):
> - Research assistance with citation requirements
> - Outline creation for original work
> - Language translation support
> 
> **❌ Not Allowed**:
> - Completing assignments for you
> - Writing final submissions without significant human input
> - Uploading personal information to AI tools
> 
> **Citation Required**: Include "AI Assistance: [Tool name] used for [specific purpose]"

---

## Module 2 - Choose & Configure Your AI Assistant

### Why Claude for Education?
- **Long-form content creation**: Detailed lesson plans and comprehensive materials
- **Document analysis**: Review student work and process course materials
- **Ethical reasoning**: Built-in consideration of bias and responsible use
- **Citation accuracy**: Better at providing proper academic references
- **Code review**: Strong debugging capabilities for technical subjects

### Configuration Prompt Template
```
You are a teaching assistant for [subject/grade level].
Context: [Brief description of your teaching context]
Default outputs: Clear headings, bullet points, tables when useful
Always provide: Sources for factual claims, limitations notes for complex topics
Never: Request or process personally identifiable information
Format preferences: [Specify your preferred output format]
Special considerations: [Any subject-specific needs]
```

---

## Module 3 - Essential Prompting Strategies

### The Prompting Framework

```
TASK: [What you want created - be specific]
CONTEXT: [Background information the AI needs]
AUDIENCE: [Who will use this - grade level, ability]
FORMAT: [How you want it structured]
CONSTRAINTS: [Limitations - time, word count, etc.]
EXAMPLES: [Show desired style if helpful]
```

### 12 Key Prompting Tips
1. **Start simple, then iterate** - Test small, add context only when needed
2. **Lead with clear action verbs** - write, classify, summarize, analyze
3. **Be specific about constraints** - word count, format, audience level
4. **Break complex tasks into steps** - Chain subtasks for better results
5. **Show don't tell** - Include 1-2 examples to anchor format
6. **Control output format** - Specify lists, headings, tables, JSON
7. **Use positive instructions** - Say what to do, not what to avoid
8. **Separate sections clearly** - Use ### to divide instruction/context/input
9. **Mind your prompt length** - Include only details that help the task
10. **Validate before finishing** - Ask AI to check requirements
11. **Reuse winning patterns** - Keep a library of effective prompts
12. **Avoid vague language** - Replace "good" with specific criteria

### Prompting Techniques

**Zero-Shot**: Give clear instruction without examples
```
"Create a 5-question quiz on photosynthesis for 8th grade students."
```

**Few-Shot**: Provide 1-3 examples to establish pattern
```
"Create discussion questions following this pattern:
Example: 'How does the author's use of imagery in paragraph 3 support the main theme?'
Now create 3 similar questions for chapters 4-6."
```

**Chain-of-Thought**: Ask for step-by-step reasoning
```
"Explain how to solve this math problem step by step, showing your reasoning at each stage."
```

## Module 5 - Assessment & Academic Integrity

### AI Assignment Levels

**Level 1 - No AI**: Closed-book assessments, in-class work, oral presentations
**Level 2 - AI Planning**: Brainstorming and outlining allowed, final work is student-created
**Level 3 - AI Collaboration**: AI assistance permitted with full disclosure of use
**Level 4 - AI Partnership**: Co-creation encouraged, focus on prompt quality and iteration
**Level 5 - AI Mastery**: Complex projects requiring tool orchestration and evaluation

### Integrity Strategies (Beyond Detection)

**Process Documentation**

## Module 6 - Teaching AI Literacy

### Critical AI Thinking Activities

**1. AI vs. Human Source Comparison**
```

- Which provides better sources?
- When would you use each approach?
```

**2. Bias Detection Exercise**
```
Have students ask AI to describe [controversial topic] and analyze:

- What assumptions are embedded?
- How does prompt phrasing change responses?
- What would different communities say about this?
```

**3. Fact-Checking Challenge**
```
Students verify AI-generated claims by:
- Cross-referencing with authoritative sources

```

---

## Module 7 - Ethical Considerations & Safety

### Privacy Protection Checklist
- ❌ Never input student names, grades, or personal information
- ✅ Use generic examples ("Student A scored 85%")
- ❌ Avoid uploading identifiable student work
- ✅ Create sample work for AI analysis instead
- ❌ Don't share class roster or family information
- ✅ Focus on educational content and general scenarios

### Bias Awareness Strategies

**Content Review Process**
1. Generate AI content
2. Check for missing perspectives
3. Verify factual accuracy
4. Test with diverse examples
5. Revise for inclusivity
6. Document limitations

**Student Bias Detection Training**
```
Teach students to ask:
- Who is represented in this response?
- Whose voices might be missing?
- What assumptions are being made?
- How might different groups respond?
- What questions should I ask next?
```

### Ethical Use Prompts

**Bias Check Template**
```
Review this AI-generated content for potential bias:
[Insert content]
Identify: Missing perspectives, unfair assumptions, stereotypes,
cultural limitations. Suggest 3 ways to make it more inclusive.
```

**Fact Verification Request**
```
Fact-check this information and identify any claims that need verification:
[Insert content]
Provide: Accuracy assessment, source recommendations, 
uncertainty flags for questionable claims.
```
